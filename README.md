# Poisson ImageInpainting
In this repo, I provide code for seamlessly blending patches of image from source image into destination image 
using Poisson Image Editing Techniques. I also demonstrate techniques to achieve nice effects like changing color of 
selected regions of image, also called as color Pop Effect, seamless tiling in images, inserting or removing local 
illumination effects and texture flattening.
